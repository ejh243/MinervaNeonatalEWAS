# MinervaNeonatalEWAS
This repository contains analytical scripts to perform the EWAS reported in Hannon et al. Prenatal and obstetric influences on DNA methylation in neonates.Under Review. 

Analysis scripts for epigenome-wide association study of gestational age, birth weight and maternal smoking in MINERvA study (a subset of iPSYCH). These accompany the manuscript: Elevated polygenic burden for autism is associated with differential DNA methylation at birth (under review).

In this repo there are scripts that demonstrate:

1. The epigenome-wide association study of gestational age, birth weight and maternal smoking.
2. Clumping and conditional analyses of EWAS results.
3. Mediation analysis of DNA methylation between maternal smoking and birth weight.
4. SIMEX correction of mediation analysis

For scripts relating to the QC of the data please look in the [MinervaASDEWAS repo](https://github.com/ejh243/MinervaASDEWAS.git). 

Please note that for security reasons filepaths and identifiers have been removed, therefore these serve purely as a guide to the analysis.
